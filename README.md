 For the color tracking script "openCV_colorTracking.py" you need numpy and cv2
 To import cv2 run in terminal:
 pip install opencv-python
 and for numpy:
 pip install numpy


For the ColorTracking.py and get.py you need shared momery dictionary for python.
Install with: pip install shared-memory-dict
In order for unity to work with the python script, ColorTracking.py in Assets must run before the unity project runs.
